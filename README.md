# SADP_tasks
This one is for storaging my uni "Structures&amp;Algorithms of Data Processing" tasks. Each task is in a separate project of a solution. 

## Task one
TASK: research the time of inputting of 7 arrays of sizes 10000, 20000, ..., 70000 with three diffenrent algorithms:
1. new elemnts are put to the beggining of array;
2. new elemnts are put to the end of array;
3. new elemnts are put in the middle of array with a random index.
RESULTING DATA: text file with database, containing 3 columns: 1) time of inputting, 2) size of array, 3) type of input algorithm.
